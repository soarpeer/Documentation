## P2P DNS Node Reputation
Read the detailed P2P DNS Node Reputation documentation here. This documentation covers everything you need to know about our P2P DNS Node Reputation system, including setup, configuration, and best practices.
<Warning>Please note that this documentation is a work in progress and may be updated frequently as we continue to enhance our P2P DNS Node Reputation offerings.</Warning>

## Let's get started!
The P2P DNS Node Reputation system is a crucial part of the SoarPeer ecosystem, enabling the evaluation and management of node trustworthiness within the P2P DNS network. It helps ensure that nodes participating in the network maintain high standards of reliability and performance.

All nodes start with a neutral reputation score. As nodes participate in the network, their actions are monitored and evaluated based on various criteria, such as uptime, response time, and accuracy of DNS resolutions. Positive contributions lead to an increase in reputation, while negative behaviors result in a decrease.
Whenever a node runs out of reputation points, it may face temporary suspension from participating in the P2P DNS network. This mechanism encourages nodes to maintain good behavior and contribute positively to the network's overall health.
Reputation scores are periodically reviewed and adjusted based on the latest performance data. Nodes with consistently high reputation scores may receive additional benefits, such as priority in DNS query handling or eligibility for network incentives.
We do frequent reputation audits and resets. This is to ensure that nodes have a fair chance to improve their standing within the network. Nodes that have previously faced penalties can work towards rebuilding their reputation through consistent positive contributions.

We give everyone a fair chance to participate in the P2P DNS network. However, maintaining a good reputation is essential for long-term success and reliability within the ecosystem.
