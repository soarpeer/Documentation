## P2P DNS Node Requirements
Read the detailed P2P DNS Node Requirements documentation here. This documentation covers everything you need to know about the hardware and software requirements for running a P2P DNS node effectively.
<Warning>Please note that this documentation is a work in progress and may be updated frequently as we continue to enhance our P2P DNS offerings.</Warning>

## Node Requirements
To participate in the P2P DNS network, nodes must meet certain requirements to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Below are the key requirements for running a P2P DNS node:
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Minimum of 4 CPU cores
  - At least 8 GB of RAM
  - Minimum of 100 GB of SSD storage
  - Reliable network connection with at least 10 Mbps upload and download speeds
- **Software Requirements**:
    - Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later recommended) OR SourPeer OS
    - P2P DNS Node Software: Latest stable version of the SoarPeer P2P DNS node software
    - Dependencies: Ensure all required dependencies are installed as per the installation guide
- **Uptime Requirements**:
    - Nodes should aim for at least 99% uptime to ensure consistent availability within the network
    - Regular monitoring and maintenance are recommended to address any potential issues promptly
- **Security Requirements**:
    - Implement firewall rules to restrict unauthorized access
    - Regularly update the node software to patch any security vulnerabilities
    - Use strong authentication methods for node access
Meeting these requirements will help ensure that your P2P DNS node operates efficiently and contributes positively to the overall health of the SoarPeer P2P DNS network.

Our team is continuously working to improve the P2P DNS system, and we may update these requirements as needed. Please refer to this documentation regularly for the latest information.
The requirements are subjected to change based on network demands and technological advancements. Always ensure your node meets the latest specifications to maintain optimal performance.
